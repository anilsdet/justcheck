# 🧱 Performance of Hybrid Fibre Reinforced Self-Compacting Concrete

This project investigates the mechanical behavior of M30 grade Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) reinforced with steel, glass, and hybrid fibers. It includes experimental data, mix design methodology, and analysis of fresh and hardened concrete properties.

---

## 📚 Overview

The study explores how fiber reinforcement --- specifically steel, glass, and hybrid combinations --- enhances the compressive and tensile strength of SCC. Hybrid Fiber Reinforced SCC (HFRSCC) showed the highest performance, with a 11.84% increase in compressive strength and 14.43% increase in tensile strength compared to plain SCC.
